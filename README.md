# dawgtreats
This is a program that extracts the data for what cookie will be served at each dining hall every day and  presents it to the user. If there is no cookie that is being served that day, then the program will indicate that. Our goal was
to extract the information from the website and successfully write the code to figure out what cookie is being served every day. We were able to do this part successfully. The second part of our project was to create a
website where this information could be accessed. On this part of the project, we were able to design the website, however, we were not able to link the code to the website. We decided to name our domain DawgTreats.tech, as we felt
it applied to UGA students (Bulldogs being the mascot of UGA) and we felt that it was a fun play on words when referring to the cookies being served as Dawg Treats. When we tried to file the Domain Name, however, we were not able to
complete the process, as the website we were using to create the website was not allowing us to use the domain. We have included a screenshot of the problem arising as well as the name of the domain we tried using. We were able to
verify the domain name using domain.com, however, it never went through and actually created.

We feel that this program and website, when it works, would be an easy and personal way for students to check on what types of cookies are available at each dining hall. We feel that this is something that would be beneficial to all
UGA students with dining halls, as the cookies that are served have become favorites of almost everyone who frequents the dining halls. We wanted to create something that would be beneficial and useful to people on our campus as well
as something that would allow us to grow and learn more about Java and coding in general.
